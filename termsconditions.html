                                limited to: participating in any type of collusion with other players;

                                other online casinos or payment providers chargeback transactions with a credit
                                card; denial of some
                                payments made; creating two or more accounts; other types of cheating; or
                                becoming bankrupt in the
                                country of their residence, the Company reserves the right to terminate such
                                account and suspend all
                                payouts to the player. This decision is at the sole discretion of the Company
                                and the player will
                                not be notified or informed about the reasons for such actions. The Company also
                                reserves the right
                                to inform applicable regulatory bodies of the fraudulent actions performed by
                                the player; delaying
                                game rounds in any game (including Free Spins and bonus features) to a later
                                time when you have no
                                wagering requirements; leaving large bets on the table (for example, in
                                Blackjack) and returning to
                                the game after bonus wagering has been completed; playing games with bonus money
                                to build up in-game
                                value, losing the bonus funds, and then cashing out on the built-up value during
                                real-money play; or
                                using strategies that take advantage of any software bug or failure.</p>

                            <p>Should the Casino become aware of any user who has accepted a bonus or
                                a promotion with the sole purpose of creating a positive expected value on bonus
                                return by using
                                known practices aimed at securing cash out of said bonus, or in any way try to
                                take advantage of
                                bonuses received by the Casino, then we will enforce immediate confiscation of

                                of the account, with the right to withhold any further withdrawals. An example
                                of advantage play
                                would be delaying any game round in any game, including Free Spins features and
                                bonus features, to a
                                later time when you have no more wagering requirements and/or performing new

                                Free Spins features or bonus features still available in the game. The Casino
                                reserves the right to
