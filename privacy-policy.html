                        we
                        can still store your information, but will not use it further. We keep lists of people who have

                        further use of their information to be ‘blocked’ to make sure the restriction is respected in
                        the future.
                        This
                        right is available to you when: </p>

                        reuse
                        your information for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to
                        switch to a
                        different provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between

                        you have the
                        right
                        to withdraw your consent at any time. We’ll always strive to make it easy for you to withdraw
                        consent by
                        choosing an “unsubscribe” option in every communication you receive from us. If you find this
                        isn’t the
                        case,
                        then just get in touch with our Data Protection Officer at our Contact email, and we’ll try to

                        if
                        your account may be being used for fraud or money laundering. If we think there is a risk of
