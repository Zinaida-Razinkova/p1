                    <h2>HOW DO WE COMMIT TO RESPONSIBLE GAMING?</h2>
                    <p>Gambling at an online casino should always be aimed at entertainment. However, there is a
                        certain percentage of
                        people who lose control over themselves while gambling. Before starting to play, it is
                        important to realize that
                        gambling shall never be viewed as a source of income or a means of recovery from debts. It
                        is useful to keep
                        track of the time and the amount of money spent at an online casino daily.If you think that
                        you'll start
                        spending more money than you can afford, or in case gaming starts interfering with your
                        normal daily routines,
                        we strongly advise considering several measures that can help, such as setting Limits on
                        your gaming activities,
                        opting for Self-Exclusion, and seeking help and support from trusted independent bodies. You
                        can take the
                        gambling addiction <a

                        to determine
                        whether you are exhibiting signs of an addiction to gambling.</p>
                    <h2>LET’S SEE SOME ID</h2>

                    <p><u>2. Gaming Problem</u></p>
                    <p>There are lots of activities that can become a problem if not done in moderation (for
                        example, alcohol
                        consumption, shopping, and playing video games). The same can occur with gaming. Signs of
                        addiction are often
                        hard to see in yourself or in another person and very often may not even be related to
                        money. Gambling can be a
                        symptom of a wider problem.It may be that a game has become a means of escape or of not
                        confronting another
                        dilemma. It can be that the motivation is so subconscious that the person is not even aware
                        of the real issues
                        and the possible consequences. In that case, there is professional help available.It is
                        critically important to
                        catch this kind of behavior early before the practical consequences have a chance to impact.
                        Unfortunately for
                        this disease, the symptoms are not just physical but can be financial and
                        social.Fortunately, most of us can bet
                        and play happily all our lives without it ever becoming a problem.</p>
                    <p><u>3. How do I tell if I am at risk?<br></u></p>

                        <li>Set a daily, weekly, or monthly budget well within the limits of what you can afford to
                            lose. </li>
                        <li>Never play cards or casino for money when you are drunk, on drugs, tired or feeling

                    <p>If you feel you may be at risk of developing a dependency on gambling, there are many special
                        services and
                        websites that can help you. You can find a simple self-assessment test on <a

                        which can help you determine whether gaming may be becoming a problem for you.</p>

                        developing a dependency
                        towards gambling.</p>
                    <p>The Website has put in place a series of measures so that members can bet and play in a safe

                        if a coin has been flipped ten times and comes up heads ten times, the chances of it being
                        tailed on the next
                        spin are still 50%. </p>

                        fun. In order to make

                        consider these measures
                        when playing on The Website.</p>
                    <p><u>5. Limits<br></u></p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.1. Set a limit</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Deposit limits are part of our Responsible Gaming Policy and can
                        help you to control
                        the amount you spend. You can choose to implement a daily, weekly, or monthly limit.
                        Alternatively, you can
                        choose to implement a combination of these limits for extra control.We recommend that
                        members set a limit on the
                        amount of money they spend. You can do this simply at ‘My Account’ and then ‘Responsible
                        Gaming’ by inserting an
                        amount in one or more of the ‘Daily Limit’, ‘Weekly Limit’ or ‘Monthly Limit’ boxes. It is a
                        good idea to give
                        yourself a budget. This means that if you start to play more than you want to, you will be
                        alerted.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">If you set a deposit limit, any request by you to increase or
                        remove that limit will
                        not take effect for 24 hours. This is to give you a chance to have a period of time that
                        will allow you to
                        reconsider whether you really want to raise your deposit limit. If you make a request to
                        lower your deposit
                        limit before the relevant period has ended or to set a limit, this request will take effect
                        immediately. You may
                        also want to set Wagering Limits which will allow you to control the maximum amount you
                        agree to wager in each
                        time period.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.2. Daily Limits</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Daily limits are set for a period of 24 hours. As with all limits,
                        they consider the
                        amount deposited during the previous period. For example, if you have already made a deposit
                        of €20 in the past
                        24 hours and you select a daily deposit limit of €20, you will not be able to deposit again
                        until a further 24
                        hours have passed since your last deposit. If you have made a deposit of €10 in the past 24
                        hours and you select
                        a daily deposit limit of €20, you will only be able to deposit a maximum of €10 until 24
                        hours have passed since
                        your last deposit</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.3. Weekly Limits</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Weekly limits are set for a period of 168 hours. As with all
                        limits, they consider the
                        amount deposited during the previous period. For example, if you have already made a deposit
                        of €20 in the past
                        168 hours and you select a weekly deposit limit of €20, you will not be able to deposit
                        again until a further
                        168 hours have passed since your last deposit. If you have made a deposit of €10 in the past
                        168 hours and you
                        select a weekly deposit limit of €20, you will only be able to deposit a maximum of €10
                        until 168 hours have
                        passed since your last deposit.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Note: If you already have a daily limit in place and you set a
                        weekly amount that is
                        less than your daily limit, your daily limit will be deleted and only the weekly limit will
                        be implemented. If
                        your weekly deposit limit is set higher than your daily limit, you will not be able to
                        exceed the weekly limit.
                        For example, if your daily limit is set at €10 and your weekly limit is set at €20, you can
                        deposit up to €10
                        per day for two days, but you will not be able to deposit more until 168 hours have passed
                        since your last
                        deposit.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.4. Monthly Limits</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Monthly limits are set for a period of 720 hours. As with all
                        limits, they take into
                        account the amount deposited during the previous period. For example, if you have already
                        made a deposit of €50
                        in the past 720 hours and you select a monthly deposit limit of €50, you will not be able to
                        deposit again until
                        a further 720 hours have passed since your last deposit. If you have made a deposit of €20
                        in the past 720 hours
                        and you have set a deposit limit of €50, you will only be able to deposit a maximum of €30
                        until 720 hours have
                        passed since your last deposit.</p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Note: If you already have a daily and/or weekly limit in place and
                        your monthly limit
                        is set as an amount that is less than those limits, those limits will be deleted and only
                        the monthly limit will
                        be implemented. If your monthly limit is set higher than your daily and weekly limits, you
                        will not be able to
                        exceed the monthly limit. For example, if your daily limit is set at €10 and your weekly
                        limit is set at €20 and
                        your monthly limit is set at €50, you can deposit up to €10 per day for two days, but you
                        will not be able to
                        deposit further until 168 hours have passed since your last deposit.</p>

                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">Your account gives you a complete record of all the bets you have

                        easy and simple to keep track of what you are doing, how long it is taking and whether you
                        are betting sensibly
                        or not.</p>
                    <p><u>7. Contact our Customer Service Team<br></u></p>

                    <p><u>8. Self-Exclusion<br></u></p>
                    <p style="margin-left:20px;">If you feel that you may be becoming dependent on gambling, you
                        should consider
                        permanently excluding yourself from all gambling environments. If you take the decision that
                        you no longer want
                        to play at the Website, you can permanently block your access by contacting our Customer
                        Service team by
                        emailing the support team, and changing your account status to “Permanent self-exclusion”.
                        If you wish to
                        self-exclude yourself for a set period, you can do this by contacting our support.</p>
